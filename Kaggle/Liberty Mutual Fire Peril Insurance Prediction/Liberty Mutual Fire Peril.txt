This data represents almost a million insurance records and the task is to predict a transformed ratio of loss to total insured value (called "target" within the data set). The provided features contain policy characteristics, information on crime rate, geodemographics, and weather.

The train and test sets are split randomly. For each id in the test set, you must predict the target using the provided features.



Data Fields
================
id : A unique identifier of the data set

target : The transformed ratio of loss to total insured value

dummy : Nuisance variable used to control the model, but not working as a predictor

var1 – var17 : A set of normalized variables representing policy characteristics (note: var11 is the weight used in the weighted gini score calculation)

crimeVar1 – crimeVar9: A set of normalized Crime Rate variables

geodemVar1 – geodemVar37 : A set of normalized geodemographic variables

weatherVar1 – weatherVar236 : A set of normalized weather station variables

* : Level "Z" in these variable represents a missing value. Missing values elsewhere in the data are denoted with NA

+: Levels for var4 are in a hierarchical structure. The letter represents higher level and the number following the letter represents lower level nested within the higher level.
